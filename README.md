## Example Description

## Example Artefacts Overview

The example is available at https://github.com/into-cps/case-study_uav_swarm in the *master* branch. There are several subfolders for the various elements: FMU - contains the various FMUs of the study; Models - contains the constituent models defined using the INTO-CPS simulation technologies; Multi-models - contains the multi-model definitions and co-simulation configurations - with 3D and non-3D options; and SysML - contains the SysML model defined for the study.

The case-study_uav_swarm folder can be opened in the INTO-CPS application to run various co-simulation experiments. The description of these is to follow. This study is a work in progress, and therefore there may be elements which are not yet working fully.
